  <p>I solemnly swear to make things funky, spunky and phresh. I will create with the aim of originality with the preservation of tradition and an appreciation for the classics. Although I will work as best I can to suit the clientâ€™s wishes, I will try my best to preserve the style that is signaturely my own. I will never feel shame for the design I enjoy, my inspirations, and the art that I love. When I see another artist succeeding, I will cheer them on. When I see another artist who might need a little pick me up, I will encourage them. To be a designer is to fully participate and become a member of the community.</p>
